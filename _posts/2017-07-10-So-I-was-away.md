"*Are bhai ye S1 ka 24 hai. Apka S7 me hoga*", said the guy standing infront of me. Holding a bag way too heavy than he could lift. His face had a tired look to it. Maybe it was the heat or the weigth of the bags he was carrying or maybe just the city itself. It was Kota afterall.

There were many like him. Even I was one of them. Going back home, after toiling a year or two, even three, trying to achieve the pinnacle of the Indian Middle Class dream. A seat in IITs or NITs.

"*Haan bhai mera S7 me hai. Sorry galat dekh liye the*", I replied cursing myself that how can I be so careless. Now I had to walk accross six over crowded compartments carrying 3 heavy bags. Oh boy it was going to be a long sweaty walk. With mercury well over 40 degree celcius, somehow squeezing myself through people, I reached my berth. It was occupied by few guys. They vacated my seat after I indicated it was mine. With a loud *hoooof* I let myself fall on that '166 X 58 cm piece of hard foam packed around with blue vinyl' sleeper seat. I was sweating from every place possible, but happy that I had made it at last. I was happy that soon this 'Kota-Patna Express' will take me away. Away from this factory of a city. I was exhausted. But I wasn't like this 11 months 8 days before.

Like every other student who puts his feet on the holy land of Kota at beggining of their course, I was excited. I was going to study in the *Best Coaching Institute of the Country* ALLEN Career Institute. I was determined.
